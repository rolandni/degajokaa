<p>It seems that the film was released a few days ago. Videos, stills of the film are still discussed on Facebook, YouTube. But the film &#8216;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8217; has completed 20 years. The popular pair &#8216;Munna Bhai-Circuit&#8217; of this film is still etched in the minds of the audience. Rajkumar Hirani&#8217;s film starred Sanjay Dutt as &#8216;Munna Bhai&#8217; and Arshad Warsi as his assistant &#8216;Circuit&#8217;. These two stars shared an emotional post on the 20th anniversary of &#8216;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8217; today.<br>20 years ago today, the film &#8216;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8217; was released. The film did great business at the box office. That&#8217;s all, from nine to ninety, everyone&#8217;s heart was touched by the image of the prince. Sanjay&#8217;s sinking career was saved by the film &#8216;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8217;. Boman Irani, Jimmy Shergill, Gracie Singh were other main characters of this film. Sanjay Dutt&#8217;s father and late popular actor Sunil Dutt was seen in an important role in the film. He also played the role of Sanjay&#8217;s father in &#8216;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8217;.<br>On Tuesday, Sanjay Dutt posted a video on the 20th anniversary of the film &#8216;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8217;.</p>



<p>He made the video covering several memorable scenes of this film. Sunil Dutt is also seen in this video. Sanjay wrote a heart touching caption with this post. The Bollywood star wrote, &#8216;Two decades of laughter, emotion, and lots of &#8220;jaadu ki zhappi&#8221;.</p>



<p>A festive mood marking 20 years of “Munna Bhai MBBS”. A memorable trip. A few moments to never forget. I would like to thank everyone for this love, their love made this film timeless. Hopefully, &#8220;Munna Bhai 3&#8221; will be made soon.&#8217;<br>Meanwhile Arshad Warshi posted a beautiful post on the 20th anniversary of &#8216;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8217;. He posted a picture of the &#8216;Munna Bhai-Circuit&#8217; duo and wrote, &#8216;The 20 years of &#8220;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8221; seems like yesterday. Thank you all for giving so much love to Munna and the circuit.&#8217;</p>



<p>After the huge success of &#8216;Munna Bhai MBBS&#8217;, Rajkumar made its sequel. In 2006 he brought the film &#8216;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&#8217;. This film was built around Gandhism. The film &#8216;Lage Raho Munna Bhai&#8217; was also a huge success. Again the &#8216;Munna Bhai-Circuit&#8217; duo won the hearts of the audience. Then Rajkumar Hirani announced &#8216;Munna Bhai 3&#8217;. But there is still no update around this picture. Meanwhile, Rajkumar Hirani&#8217;s &#8216;Danki&#8217; is going to release next Thursday. Shah Rukh Khan and Taapsee Pannu will be seen together in this film.</p>
